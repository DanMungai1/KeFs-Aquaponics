**Aquaponics** is the *integration* of recirculating **aquaculture** and **hydroponics** in one production system. Although the production of fish and vegetables is the most visible output of aquaponic units, aquaponics is the management of a complete ecosystem that includes three major groups of organisms: fish, plants and bacteria.

# System balance

*Aquaponic* systems need to be **balanced**. The fish (and thus, fish feed) need to supply adequate *nutrients* for the plants. The plants need to filter the water for the fish. The **biofilter** needs to be large enough to process all of the fish wastes, and **enough water volume** is needed to circulate this system.

The ratio estimates determine how much fish feed should be added each day to the system, and it is calculated based on the area available for plant growth. This ratio depends on the type of plant being 
grown; fruiting vegetables require about one-third more nutrients than leafy greens to support flowers and fruit development. 

The type of feed also influences the feed rate ratio.

# Facts
- On average, the fish will consume 1 to 2 percent of their body weight per day during the grow-out stage. This assumes that the fish are larger than 50 g because small fish eat more than large ones, as a percentage of body weight

- The recommended maximum stocking density is 20 kg of fish for 1 000 litres of water (fish tank).

Higher stocking densities require more sophisticated aeration techniques to keep the DO levels stable for fish, as well as a more complex filtration system to deal with the solid waste

- The recommended fish density is based on a maximum stocking density of 20 kg per 1 000 litres.

- The recommended feeding rate is 1 percent of body weight per day for fish of more than 100 g of body mass

- The volumes for mechanical separator and biofilter should be 10 to 30 percent of total fish tank volume. 

**Disease, nutritional deficiencies and death are symptoms of an unbalanced system. Water testing will provide information on the balance of the system. High ammonia or nitrite indicates insufficient biofiltration. Low nitrate indicates too many plants or not enough fish.**

# System cycling and starting a biofilter colony

Bacteria are a crucial and pivotal aspect of aquaponics, serving as the bridge that connects the fish waste to the plant fertilizer. 

The nitrifying bacteria convert the fish waste, which enters the system mainly as ammonia, into nitrate, which is fertilizer for the plants. This is a two‑step process, and two separate groups of nitrifying bacteria are involved.

**A good establishment of the bacteria colony is crucial for a new aquaponic system.**

System cycling is a term that describes the initial process of building a bacterial colony when first starting any aquaponic unit

Overall, the process involves constantly introducing an ammonia source into the aquaponic unit, feeding the new bacterial colony, and creating a biofilter. 

The progress is measured by monitoring the nitrogen levels using the nitrate test kit.

Once introduced into the unit, the ammonia becomes an initial food source for the ammonia‑oxidizing bacteria (AOB), a few of which are naturally occurring and recruit to the system on their own. 

In good conditions, this takes about 25 to 40 days, but if the water temperature is cool, complete cycling may take up to two months to finish. At this point, a sufficient bacterial colony has formed and is actively converting the ammonia to nitrate.

# Management practices for plants
Seedlings can be planted into the system as soon as nitrates are detected. Expect these first plants to grow slowly and exhibit some temporary deficiencies because the nutrient supply in the water is temporarily small. 

**It is recommended to wait three to four weeks to allow the nutrients to accumulate.**

#  Plant spacing
Seedlings can be planted using a slightly denser spacing than for most vegetables in soil because in aquaponics the plants do not compete for water and nutrients. 

Some new aquaponic units experience iron deficiencies in the first two to three months of growing as iron is important during the early stages of plant growth and is not abundant in fish feed. Thus, it may be necessary to initially add chelated iron (soluble iron in powder form) to the unit to meet the requirements for plants. The recommendation is to add 1 to 2 mg per litre for the first three months of starting a unit,


Iron can also be supplemented by using aquaponics-safe organic fertilizers such as compost or seaweed tea, as iron is abundant in both.

# Harvesting plants

In one to two months, leafy green vegetables should be ready to harvest. After three months, the unit should also have enough of a nutrient base to begin planting larger fruiting vegetables.

# Management practices for fish

It is best to wait until the initial cycling process is totally completed and the biofilter is fully functioning to add the fishes to the system. If it is decided to add fish before cycling, then a reduced number of fish should be added. This time will be very stressful for the fish, and water changes may be necessary

Species suitable for aquaponic farming include tilapia, common carp, silver carp, grass carp, barramundi, jade perch, catfish, trout, salmon, Murray cod, and largemouth bass.
---
# Acclimatizing fish
There are two main factors that cause stress when acclimatizing fish: changes in temperature and pH between the original water and new water. If the pH values are more than 0.5 different, then the fish will need at least 24 hours to adjust. 

Keep the fish in a small aerated tank of their original water and slowly add water from the new tank over the course of a day

Slowly allow the temperature to equilibrate by floating the sealed transportation bags containing the fish in the culture water. This should be done for at least 15 minutes. 

At this time small amounts of water should be added from the culture water to the bag water

# Fish feeding and growth rates

The feed rate ratio provides a way to balance the components of an aquaponic system, and to calculate planting area, fish feed, and fish biomass.

During the grow-out stage of the fish, it is recommended a fish feeding rate of 1 to 2 percent of their body weight per day. Considering a fish stocking density of 10 to 20 kg per 1 000 litres, 200 g of feed per day can be provided.

During the first two to three months, the fish are small (50 grams weight for a fingerling tilapia) and eat about 3 percent of their body weight per day. Therefore, an initial stocking of 40 fingerlings would weigh 2 000 g, and together they would eat approximately 60 g of fish feed per day.


After two to three months feeding at this rate, the 40 fish will have grown to 80 to 100 grams each and weigh a total of 3 200 to 4 000 g. At this point, they should be able to eat 80 to 100 g of feed per day.
---

Make sure to divide the feeding into morning and afternoon rations. Moreover, juvenile fish benefit from an additional lunch–time feeding. Splitting the ration is healthier for the fish and also healthier for the plants, providing an even distribution of nutrients throughout the day


Spread the feed across the entire surface of the water so all the fish can eat without injuring one another or hitting the side of the tank. Avoid scaring the fish during feeding by refraining from sudden movements. Stand still and observe the fish.

Always remove any uneaten fish food after 30 minutes, and adjust the next feeding ration accordingly. If there is no food left after 30 minutes, increase the ration. If there is a lot left, decrease the ration.

## Routine management practices
###  Daily activities
- Check that the water and air pumps are working well, and clean their inlets from obstructions.Check that water is flowing.

- Check the water level, and add additional water to compensate for evaporation, as necessary.

- Check for leaks.

- Check water temperature.

- Feed the fish (two to three times a day if possible), remove uneaten feed and adjust feeding rates.

- At each feeding, check the behaviour and appearance of the fish.

- Check the plants for pests. Manage pests, as necessary.

- Remove any dead fish. Remove any sick plants/branches.

- Remove solids from the clarifier and rinse 
any filters.
---
###  Weekly activities
- Perform water quality tests for pH, ammonia, nitrite and nitrate before feeding the fish.

- Adjust the pH, as necessary

- Check the plants looking for deficiencies. Add organic fertilizer, as necessary.

- Clear fish waste from the bottom of fish tanks and in the biofilter.

- Plant and harvest the vegetables, as required.

- Harvest fish, if required.

- Check that plant roots are not obstructing any pipes or water flow.
---
# Monthly activities
- Stock new fish in the tanks, if required.

- Clean out the biofilter, clarifier and all the filters.

- Clean the bottom of the fish tank using fish nets.

- Weigh a sample of fish and check thoroughly for any disease.
